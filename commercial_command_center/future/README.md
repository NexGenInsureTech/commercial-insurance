# Future Strategy Logic (DO NOT DELETE)

These files contain intentionally dormant logic
for future phases of the Commercial Insurance
Command Center.

Rules here are:

- Not imported
- Not executed
- Not safe to activate casually

Activation requires:

1. Strategy approval
2. Switch ON in /config/strategyRules.js
3. Explicit injection in strategy pages
4. Audit note & version bump
